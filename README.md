Project made for faculty WEB development course.

Final decision about project content is to make multipage
website for football data and results. Decision is made based on better
APIs that are free to use (APIs are provided on RapidAPI marketplace).

IDE in which project will be developed is VS Code.
If neccessary, firebase database will be used for storing data.

Language in which web page will be developed is Javascript.
Additional libraries that will be used are Bootstrap 5 and JQuery.
	
Idea for LV2 is to set environment for project development and
to make basic page structure.
